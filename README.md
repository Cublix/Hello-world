# Hello-world
First Repository of many :) 


Hello! Im a Chef that has always loved gaming and computers. I live with a bunch of Software engineers and being totally surrounded by code talk it has hit me that I've wanted to give it a try. So far its been fun - can't wait to create and make my digital mark on the world!
